## Overview

In this project, I was responsible for designing and implementing the user interface of the website. Using Figma, I created visually appealing and user-friendly designs, which I then translated into code with React.js. The website aims to provide the public with up-to-date and relevant legal information and news. Additionally, it offers opportunities for students and fresh graduates to contribute to the team through internship programs.

## Key Features

- **Responsive UI Design**: Designed an engaging and responsive user interface in Figma, ensuring compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Frontend Development**: Transformed the designs into functional, reusable React.js components integrated seamlessly with the Laravel backend using Inertia.js.
- **Educational Content**: Developed features to display legal news, articles, and resources, enabling the public to stay informed about the latest legal updates.
- **Internship Platform**: Created a system for managing internship applications, encouraging students and fresh graduates to participate in legal education initiatives.

## Technologies Used

- **Laravel**: For backend development and managing the monolithic architecture.
- **Inertia.js**: For bridging the Laravel backend with the React.js frontend.
- **React.js**: For building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **Figma**: For crafting design prototypes and ensuring a seamless handoff to development.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the primary challenges was ensuring the smooth integration of designs into the Laravel-Inertia.js environment while maintaining responsiveness and performance. Through this project, I learned the importance of close collaboration between design and development teams, particularly in using tools like Figma for effective communication.

## Outcome

The LabLaw website successfully delivers accurate and timely legal education to the public. It also fosters collaboration and learning by engaging students and fresh graduates in the development process through internships. The project has enhanced my skills in front-end development and teamwork, laying a foundation for future endeavors in similar fields.
